My original intention with purchasing the domain leisr.li was to write a simple company holiday/vacation planner app.

I don't believe employees need a limitation on how many days holiday they can take per annum. I don't really think vacation needs to be **"approved"** by management and I don't really think that kind of thing is management's responsibility, in the first place.

We tend to apply the **"don't be a dick"** principle and think people should inform their team mates.

All the MVP of a holiday/vacation planner app needs to do is inform people about who is going to be around and optionally notify them when someone plans to take time off. Secondly, the app should nudge people to book time off if they haven't done so in a while.
