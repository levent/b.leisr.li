My original intention with purchasing the domain leisr.li was to write a simple company holiday/vacation planner app.

I don't believe employees need a limitation on how many days holiday they can take per annum. I don't really think vacation needs to be **"approved"** by management and I don't really think that kind of thing is management's responsibility in the first place.

We tend to apply the **"don't be a dick"** principle and think people should just inform their team mates of their plans.

All the MVP of our holiday/vacation planner app needs to do is inform people about who is around and notify them when someone plans to take time off. Secondly, the app should nudge people to book time off if they haven't done so in a while.
